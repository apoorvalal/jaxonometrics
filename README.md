# `jaxonometrics`: Econometrics in jax

Simple library that provides performant implementations of standard econometrics routines in the JAX ecosystem. 

- `jax` arrays everywhere
- `lineax` for solving linear systems
- `jaxopt` and `optax` for numerical optimization (Levenbergâ€“Marquardt for NNLS-type problems and SGD for larger problems)
